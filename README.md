Introduction

The Föppl–von Kármán equations are named after August Föppl and Theodore von Kármán are a set of nonlinear partial differential equations describing the large deflections of thin flat plates.With applications ranging from the design of submarine hulls to the mechanical properties of cell wall. In our problem statememnt we have considered Buckling of Uniformely compresssed Rectangular plate simply supported along two opposite sides perpendicular in the direction of compression and having various edge conditions along the other two sides.


Problem statement

Here we are considering rectangular plate with dimensions  and  along  and  directions respectively.
The Reactangular plate is simply supported at the edges  and .
The plate is subjected to a compressive load along the  - direction and the magnitude of the load is .
The special condition that we have considered is that at  the plate is simply supported and at  it is free.
